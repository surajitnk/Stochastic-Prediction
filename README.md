# EMI Collection Probability Prediction

This project is also part of IDFC_FIRST Bank Hackathon project. In this project, we have developed a collections model to predict the probability of a customer not paying their EMI in the next month. This prediction is essential for the bank to optimize its collection strategies and improve cash flow while maintaining good customer relationships.

## Background

The success of Debt Collection lies in timely intervention by the bank. If a customer doesn't pay their EMI, the aim is to recover the money within the same month to improve the cash flow of the bank and reduce losses. It is imperative to select the right allocation channel for connecting with the customer (Customer visit / Calling / SMS) to minimize the collection cost of the company as well as maintain a good customer relationship.

Thus, for efficient collections, it is important to devise optimal allocation strategies based on the risk of the customer, which is represented by the probability of not paying EMI in the next 1 month. This project aims to address this challenge by building a predictive model.

## Project Overview

In this project, we have developed a predictive model that estimates the probability of a customer failing to pay their EMI in the upcoming month. By utilizing historical data and various features related to the customer's financial behavior, the model assists the bank in making informed decisions regarding collection strategies.
